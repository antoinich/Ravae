# Ravae

Ravae is a narative Game created during the first hackathon organized by the Wild Code School in Nantes.
The point of the project was to use for the first time an API wich gives datas about easter egg.

The project is coded in full HTML/CSS and PHP.

We will try to improve the narration and the gameplay asap with:
-more paths to discover the adventure
-Adding action (combat/objects using and collecting)
